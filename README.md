## Preparation

Instead of starting with a sprint, we took the first day to organise in our group how we could split the work evenly and cover the content for this project to be a success.

The project board was created to allow us to collaboratively understand each other's user stories and scenarios, so there was no repeated work or gaps in the project. The project board also let us plan out our time to complete the project in time.

The skeleton of the project was created so that each of us had the same starting point for when we begin to complete our user stories. This helps with any initial merge conflicts.
