# Web Testing Mini Project
## Project Aim

The goal of this project is to look at the functionality for the website saucedemo.com, derive user stories from this and create some test cases for said user stories.

The functionality we are focusing on includes:

* Sign in and authentication
* Updating cart
* Check in to cart and authentication
* Finalising orders
* Product information

## Preparation

Instead of starting with a sprint, we took the first day to organise in our group how we could split the work evenly and cover the content for this project to be a success.

The project board was created to allow us to collaboratively understand each other's user stories and scenarios, so there was no repeated work or gaps in the project. The project board also let us plan out our time to complete the project in time.

The skeleton of the project was created so that each of us had the same starting point for when we begin to complete our user stories. This helps with any initial merge conflicts.

### Review

For the first sprint, the aim was to complete all of the coding for the project. We achieved this as a group, mainly due to the preparation that we did yesterday. The prep meant that we could quickly get started and knew that there were no conflicting or repeated areas of work within the project and also meant we could evenly split up the work so we each have a manageable work load for the day. Tests were achieved for each user story - all of which passed.

### Retrospective

The main barrier for this sprint was that two members of the team needed time for interview prep. With this added into the plan during the prep stage of this project, there was no conflict.

As a group we always had a call going which we would all be part of. This meant that we could discuss if we had any problems and help resolve them together. It was also really useful when it came to merging our work as there was always someone available to review and approve the request. The share screen function let us review merge conflicts as a group and alter the files together.

# Sprint 2
