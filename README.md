# Web Testing Mini Project
## Project Aim

The goal of this project is to look at the functionality for the website saucedemo.com, derive user stories from this and create some test cases for said user stories.

The functionality we are focusing on includes:

* Sign in and authentication
* Updating cart
* Check in to cart and authentication
* Finalising orders
* Product information

## Preparation

Instead of starting with a sprint, we took the first day to organise in our group how we could split the work evenly and cover the content for this project to be a success.

The project board was created to allow us to collaboratively understand each other's user stories and scenarios, so there was no repeated work or gaps in the project. The project board also let us plan out our time to complete the project in time.

The skeleton of the project was created so that each of us had the same starting point for when we begin to complete our user stories. This helps with any initial merge conflicts.
